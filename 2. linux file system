## Linux File System Overview

The Linux file system follows a hierarchical tree structure, starting from the root directory /.
Everything in Linux (files, directories, devices, processes) is represented as a file.
Unlike Windows (C:, D: drives), Linux doesn’t have separate drives — all storage is mounted into this single tree.

## Important Directories in Linux

| Directory | Purpose                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Root of the file system; all files & directories start here.                        |
| `/bin`    | Essential binary executables (e.g., `ls`, `cat`, `cp`).                             |
| `/sbin`   | System binaries (for administrators, e.g., `ifconfig`, `iptables`).                 |
| `/etc`    | Configuration files for system and applications (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/`). |
| `/home`   | User home directories (e.g., `/home/subash`).                                       |
| `/root`   | Home directory of the root (superuser).                                             |
| `/var`    | Variable data: logs, spool files (e.g., `/var/log/` contains system logs).          |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files, cleared after reboot.                                              |
| `/usr`    | User programs and libraries (non-essential at boot, e.g., `/usr/bin/`).             |
| `/lib`    | Shared libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.                        |
| `/opt`    | Optional software packages (3rd party apps).                                        |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount point for external storage.                                         |
| `/media`  | Mount point for removable media (USB, CD-ROM).                                      |
| `/dev`    | Device files (disks, terminals, printers – e.g., `/dev/sda1`).                      |
| `/proc`   | Virtual file system with process and kernel info (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`).           |
| `/sys`    | Provides information about hardware and kernel.                                     |

# Key Points for DevOps

Logs are stored in /var/log/ → useful for troubleshooting.
Configs are in /etc/ → editing configs is daily work in DevOps.
Executables in /bin, /usr/bin → used in scripts & automation.
Processes & system info in /proc → monitoring tools read from here.
Disk mounts → knowing /mnt, /media is important for cloud storage.
