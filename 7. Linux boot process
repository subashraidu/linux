Linux Boot Process

When you power on a Linux system, it goes through several stages before you see the login prompt.

#BIOS / UEFI (Firmware)
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI initializes the hardware (CPU, RAM, disks, etc.).
Performs POST (Power-On Self Test).
Looks for a boot device (hard disk, USB, network).
Loads the bootloader from the boot sector of the disk (MBR/GPT).

#Bootloader (GRUB, LILO, etc.)
The bootloader loads the operating system kernel into memory.
Common bootloaders:
GRUB2 (most popular in Linux distros)
LILO (older, rarely used)
Functions:
Displays a boot menu (if multiple OS are installed).
Loads the selected Linux kernel and the initramfs (initial RAM filesyste

#Linux Kernel
Kernel = core of the OS, manages hardware and system resources.
Once loaded, it:
Detects hardware (CPU, memory, devices).
Mounts the root filesystem (/).
Starts the init process (first user-space program).

#Init System (SysVinit / systemd / Upstart)
The init system is the first process started by the kernel (PID 1).
It initializes the system and starts services.
Modern Linux systems mostly use systemd (instead of old SysVinit).

# Runlevels / Targets
Define what services/processes start at boot.
In SysVinit, runlevels were:
0 → Halt (shutdown)
1 → Single-user mode (maintenance)
3 → Multi-user, no GUI
5 → Multi-user, GUI
6 → Reboot
In systemd, runlevels are replaced by targets:
poweroff.target → Shutdown
rescue.target → Single-user mode
multi-user.target → Multi-user, no GUI
graphical.target → Multi-user with GUI
reboot.target → Reboot

BIOS/UEFI → Initializes hardware, finds boot device.
Bootloader (GRUB) → Loads Linux kernel + initramfs.
Kernel → Initializes hardware, mounts root filesystem, starts init.
Init system (systemd) → Starts services.
Runlevels/Targets → Define system state (multi-user, GUI, etc.).
