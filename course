# operating system

An operating system (OS) is a fundamental software component that manages hardware and software resources on a computer. It serves as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling users to interact with the system and run applications.

Key functions of an operating system include:

    Hardware Management: The OS manages computer hardware resources such as CPU, memory, storage devices (hard disks, SSDs), and peripherals (printers, scanners, etc.). It allocates these resources to running programs and ensures efficient utilization.

    Process Management: It handles processes, which are instances of executing programs. This includes scheduling processes for execution, managing their execution status (running, waiting, etc.), and providing mechanisms for inter-process communication.

    Memory Management: The OS allocates and manages system memory (RAM) efficiently to ensure that each program and process has enough memory space to run without interfering with others. It also handles virtual memory management, swapping data between RAM and storage devices.

    File System Management: It provides a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories on storage devices. The OS manages file creation, deletion, modification, and access permissions. It also includes utilities for file system maintenance, such as disk formatting and file backup.

    Device Management: The OS interacts with device drivers to manage input/output (I/O) operations with hardware devices. It provides an abstraction layer that allows applications to access devices without needing to know the specifics of each device's hardware.

    User Interface: Operating systems typically provide a user interface (UI) through which users interact with the system. This can be a command-line interface (CLI), graphical user interface (GUI), or both. The UI facilitates launching applications, managing files, configuring system settings, etc.

    Security and Access Control: OSes implement security measures to protect the system and its data from unauthorized access, malware, and other threats. This includes user authentication mechanisms, access control lists (ACLs), encryption, and auditing.

    Networking: Many modern operating systems include networking capabilities to facilitate communication between computers and devices over networks. This involves managing network interfaces, protocols (TCP/IP, UDP), and providing services such as file sharing and remote access.

Operating systems come in various types, including:

    Single-user: Designed for individual users, typically found on personal computers.
    Multi-user: Supports multiple users simultaneously, commonly used in servers and mainframes.
    Real-time: Provides guaranteed response times for critical tasks, used in embedded systems and industrial applications.
    Distributed: Manages multiple computers linked by a network, working together as a single system.

Popular examples of operating systems include Windows (by Microsoft), macOS (by Apple), Linux (open-source), and Unix (historically significant, basis for many others). Each OS has its strengths and is designed to meet specific computing needs, ranging from personal computing to enterprise-level server operations.


# linux directory structure.

In Linux, file structures are organized in a hierarchical manner, following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

/ (Root directory):The top-level directory in the filesystem hierarchy.Contains all other directories and files on the system.
/bin: Essential command binaries (e.g., ls, cp, mv). banaries and executable programs
/etc: System configuration files. configuration files control how the operating system or the application behave
/home: Home directories for users.Each user typically has a subdirectory here (/home/user).
/opt: Optional application software packages. which are not bundled with the operating system
/tmp : temporary space, typically cleared on reboot 
/usr: Secondary hierarchy containing non-essential binaries, libraries, documentation, 

/usr: user related programs live 

    Secondary hierarchy containing non-essential files.
    Example subdirectories:
        /usr/bin: Non-essential command binaries.
        /usr/lib and /usr/lib64: Libraries for binaries in /usr/bin.
        /usr/share: Architecture-independent data files.
        /usr/include: Header files for C programming.

/var: Variable data files (e.g., logs, mail queues, printer spools). Mostnotably log files

/var:

    Variable data files.
    Example subdirectories:
        /var/log: System log files.
        /var/spool: Spool for various services (e.g., mail, printing).
        /var/lib: State information for programs.

/boot: Files needed for booting the system.Files needed to boot the operating system 

/dev: Device files.

    Device files representing hardware devices.
    Examples:
        /dev/sda: First SATA hard disk.
        /dev/tty1: First virtual console.
        /dev/null: Bit-bucket device (discards all data written to it).

/etc: System configuration files.

    Configuration files for the system and applications.
    Examples:
        /etc/passwd: User account information.
        /etc/fstab: Filesystem table.
        /etc/network: Network configuration files.

/lib and /lib64: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules.

/sbin: Essential system binaries (usually for system administration).
/media : used to mount removable media (CD-ROMS usbs)

/proc and /sys:

    Virtual filesystems providing access to kernel data structures.
    /proc contains runtime system information (e.g., /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo).
    /sys exposes kernel variables (e.g., /sys/block, /sys/class).


      /mnt used to mount external file systems
/opt optional or third party softwares 
/proc provides info about running softwares 
/srv data which is served by the linux server
/srv/www web server files
/srv/ftp ftp files
