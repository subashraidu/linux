# What is Package Management?

A package = software + metadata (version, dependencies, configs).
A package manager is a tool that:
Installs software
Resolves dependencies
Updates software
Removes software
Keeps the system consistent and secure
Without package managers, we would have to manually download, compile, and install software.
