### worling with files in linux ###

## cat (Concatenate & View Files)

Used to view the contents of a file quickly.
Can also create, merge, or append files

examples:
cat file.txt              # show contents of file
cat file1.txt file2.txt   # show contents of both files
cat > newfile.txt         # create file and type input (Ctrl+D to save)
cat file1.txt >> file2.txt # append file1 content to file2


## less (View Large Files Page by Page)

Used to view large files one screen at a time.
Faster than cat for big files since it doesn’t load everything into memo

examples:
less /var/log/syslog   # open log file for viewing
Navigation:
Space → Next page
b → Previous page
/word → Search forward for “word”
q → Quit

## nano (Simple File Editor)

A beginner-friendly text editor in Linux.
Easy to use compared to vi or vim.

examples:
nano file.txt   # open file in nano editor
Ctrl + O → Save (Write Out)
Ctrl + X → Exit
Ctrl + K → Cut line
Ctrl + U → Paste line

## vi / vim (Advanced Text Editor)

vi = Visual Editor (default on Linux).
vim = “Vi IMproved” (enhanced with more features like syntax highlighting).
Very powerful but has a steeper learning curve.

Modes in vi/vim:
Command Mode (default): for navigation & commands.
Insert Mode (press i): for editing text.
Last Line Mode (press :): for commands like save, quit.

examples:
vi file.txt   # open file in vi editor

i → Insert mode (start editing)
Esc → Back to command mode
:w → Save (Write)
:q → Quit
:wq → Save & quit
:q! → Quit without saving
/word → Search for “word”


In short:
cat → quick view.
less → scroll/search large files.
nano → simple editing.
vi/vim → powerful editing (default in Linux servers).
